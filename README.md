# M.I.A_tasks
Welcome to the Archive of My Completed M.I.A Tasks!
## Overview
This repository contains a collection of tasks that I have successfully completed as part of the M.I.A program.

# Task 1
For my first task, I tackled four problems using the C programming language. Below are the details of each problem:
### Problem 1: Hello Gru
- **Description:** A classic introductory program that prints "Hello GRU" to the console.
- **Solution:** [Hello_Gru.c](https://github.com/ZiadMohamedElsayed/M.I.A_tasks/blob/Task_1/Task%201/Hello_Gru.c)
### Problem 2: Counting Down
- **Description:** Counting down from a number provided by the user until reaching zero.
- **Solution:** [countdown.c](https://github.com/ZiadMohamedElsayed/M.I.A_tasks/blob/Task_1/Task%201/Counting_Down.c)
### Problem 3: Task Manager
- **Description:** Task Manager program that allows users to perform various operations such as adding, viewing, marking as complete, and removing tasks.
- **Solution:** [task_manager.c](https://github.com/ZiadMohamedElsayed/M.I.A_tasks/blob/Task_1/Task%201/Task_Manager.c)
### Problem 4: Kalman Missile
- **Description:** Implement sensor fusion for two sensors using the Kalman Filter algorithm. This algorithm helps in combining data from multiple sensors to improve accuracy.
- **Solution:** [sensor_fusion.c](https://github.com/ZiadMohamedElsayed/M.I.A_tasks/blob/Task_1/Task%201/Kalman_Missile.c)
